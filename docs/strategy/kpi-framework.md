# Digital Transformation KPI Framework

## Executive Summary

This document establishes a comprehensive Key Performance Indicator (KPI) framework to measure, monitor, and evaluate the success of Dr. Burger's digital transformation initiative. The framework is structured around five strategic dimensions: Customer Value, Financial Performance, Operational Excellence, Digital Capabilities, and Organizational Health. Each dimension includes both leading and lagging indicators with clear metrics, targets, measurement frequency, and accountability. This balanced approach ensures we monitor both immediate outcomes and long-term business impact throughout our 24-month transformation journey.

## Framework Structure

### Strategic Layers
1. **Executive Dashboard**: High-level KPIs for executive leadership (10-12 key metrics)
2. **Dimension Scorecards**: Detailed metrics for each of the five strategic dimensions
3. **Initiative Trackers**: Specific metrics for individual transformation initiatives

### Reporting Cadence
- **Weekly**: Operational metrics and initiative progress
- **Monthly**: Dimension scorecard review and trend analysis
- **Quarterly**: Executive dashboard and strategic alignment assessment
- **Annual**: Comprehensive transformation impact assessment
